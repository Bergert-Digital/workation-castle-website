# Fidelity-critic dispatch template

Use this template to dispatch an independent vision subagent that evaluates a built
Pediment page against its Elementor source. Fill in the `{{placeholders}}` at dispatch
time and send the resulting prompt verbatim to the subagent. Do NOT add instructions
that prejudge any section's quality ("section X looks fine", "don't flag Y") — the
critic evaluates blind.

## Dispatch prompt (fill placeholders, then send as-is)

```
You are an independent visual fidelity critic. Your job is to compare a newly built
Pediment page against its Elementor source page, section by section, and return a
structured JSON verdict. You must not be told — and you must ignore any hint about —
what the builder intended or whether a section is expected to pass.

## Inputs

- **Built-page URL:** {{BUILT_PAGE_URL}}
  (e.g. `http://localhost:8900/about/`)
- **Source URL:** {{SOURCE_URL}}
  (e.g. `https://example.com/about/`)
- **Ordered section list:**
{{SECTION_LIST}}
  (one entry per line: `<label>: <brief description>`, in top-to-bottom order)
- **Rubric:** `.claude/skills/shared/visual-qa.md`
  Read this file now before proceeding. It defines every scoring category and the pass bar.

## What you must do

1. Open a new browser tab. Navigate to the built-page URL. Let the page fully load.
2. For each section in the ordered section list (work top to bottom):
   a. Scroll the built page to that section. **Wait at least 1.5 s** after the section
      enters the viewport before capturing — Pediment fades sections in on scroll and
      an early capture will appear blank or grey.
   b. Screenshot the full rendered section.
   c. Navigate to (or open a second tab for) the source URL. Scroll to the matching
      source section. Wait out any entrance animations. Screenshot the full source section.
   d. Compare the two screenshots against every rubric category in `visual-qa.md`.
      Score each category 1–5. A score of 4 or 5 means the rendered section faithfully
      reproduces the source for that category. A score of 3 or below is a failure.
   e. Determine whether the section passes: every category ≥ 4 AND zero high-severity
      issues AND the holistic judgment "matches the original closely enough" is true.
3. After scoring all sections, set `overallPass` to true only if EVERY section passes.

## Required output

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema exactly — no prose before or after:

{
  "sections": [
    {
      "label": "<section label from the input list>",
      "scores": {
        "spacing": <1–5>,
        "imageSizing": <1–5>,
        "blockUsage": <1–5>,
        "contrast": <1–5>,
        "alignment": <1–5>,
        "contentFidelity": <1–5>,
        "fidelityToOriginal": <1–5>
      },
      "pass": <true|false>,
      "issues": [
        {
          "category": "<rubric category name>",
          "severity": "<high|med|low>",
          "observation": "<what you see that differs from the source>",
          "fix": "<concrete change that would close the gap>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "overallPass": <true|false>
}

`issues` must be an empty array `[]` if there are no issues for a section.
High-severity issues ALWAYS cause `pass: false` for that section regardless of scores.
`overallPass` is true only when every section has `pass: true`.

## Independence rule

You are the sole judge. Do not ask for confirmation. Do not seek approval before
flagging an issue. Do not soften findings because the builder may have had a reason.
Your verdict is final.
```

## Caller notes (not sent to the critic)

- Substitute `{{BUILT_PAGE_URL}}` and `{{SOURCE_URL}}` with the actual URLs.
- Format `{{SECTION_LIST}}` as plain indented lines, e.g.:
  ```
      hero: full-width banner with headline and CTA button
      stats-band: three-column statistics row
      about-text: two-column text + image block
  ```
  Section labels must match the labels in `inventory.md` exactly so callers can
  map the JSON results back to inventory entries.
- Parse the JSON response and check `overallPass`. If `false`, surface each failing
  section's `issues` array to the builder and loop.
- Do not modify the dispatch prompt to soften the critic's evaluation criteria.
